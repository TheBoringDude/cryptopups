**Please introduce yourself to our readers. What would you like them to know about you?**

I am Apple (my artist name), I’m the creator of the Cryptopups. Professionally, I am a graphics designer from the Philippines. I do minimalist logos, posters, business cards and many more.

**What was the inspiration for this piece?**

So, for our collaboration piece I decided to do a mothers day special. I also named the cryptopup “Swatchy” to match the collab partner. Mothers day is a special day for all the mothers in the world, so I decided to dedicate an NFT for them.

**How long have you been designing in the digital realm?**

As for how long I’ve been designing in the digital space, I started around 2 years ago; making logos, cards, posters, etc. But, for NFTs, I just started a month ago and have built a wonderful community.

**Can you tell us about your workflow (how do you come up with ideas, what tools do you use to create)?**

My workflow is kind of a mess (but im working on it). I learned from various designers that having references is a good way to come up with a design. So, before I start designing I come up with a vague idea and I look for references. from there, I start fitting different elements till I come up with something I like.

**Who are your artistic influences?**

As far as artist influencers are concerned, I really don’t have a specific favourite. I appreciate art, I appreciate artists, I love how every artist has a story and has a passion to create art.

**What got you interested in NFTs/Crypto Art/Digital Collectibles?**

Before I started NFTs I was striving as a graphics designer / Video Editor. I didn’t really have enough luck since graphics design is unappreciated in our country. but then, I discovered crypto and NFTs. I came across beeple, who sold his art for 69M$. Then I also decided to join in on the craze; but it was difficult at first. People were only interested in selling their own NFTs; so I decided to create a community of my own where we can trade, have fun, collect and support each other.
